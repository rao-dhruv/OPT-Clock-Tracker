A web extension for Chrome browser that helps F1 students track their OPT Cycle to stay updated.

Overview: I have created this Chrome extension to assist F-1 students with Optional Practical Training (OPT) by providing a visual countdown to their 90-day OPT end date. The extension also offers a dark mode option for user preference.

Features

Tracks the number of days remaining in the OPT period.
Displays start, current, and end dates in a clear format.
Provides visual cues (color-coded containers) to indicate time urgency.
Offers a dark mode option for user comfort.
Installation

Download the extension's code.
Load the unpacked extension in Chrome's extensions settings.
Usage:

Upon initial use, the extension will prompt you to enter your OPT start date.
Once the start date is entered, the extension will calculate and display the remaining days, start date, current date, and end date.
To modify the start date, click the "Modify Approval Date" button.
To toggle between light and dark mode, click the icon in the top right corner.
Technical Details: The extension is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It stores the OPT start date and end date in Chrome's local storage.

Please feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests. By using this extension, you acknowledge that you are solely responsible for managing your OPT timeline and meeting all relevant requirements.

Enjoy and All the best!
